SCRIPTS to reproduce analyses and figures

- 01_log-log_model_and_fig2.R: In this script we perform models evaluating the relationship between 
log(stand level basal area) and log(richness)

- 02_SEM.R: In this script we analyse develop an structural equation model
using piecewiseSEM to analyse how past climate change volocities
current climate conditions (annual precipitationa ane mean temperatures)
as well as number of individuals influence species richnes stand level
basal area relationships across north america

- 03_FIG_4.R: in this script we plot the std.estimates of the relationships
species richness and climate change velocities
species richness and temperature
species richness and annual precipitation
species richness and number of individuals
stand level basal area and species richness
